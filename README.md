## MERN Exercise Tracker

This project was created by following the freeCodeCamp tutorial available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M).

It's a simple application for creating, updating, deleting, and listing exercise logs.

It uses Node, Express, MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose for the backend and React (CRA) with React Router (and Reactstrap) on the frontend.
